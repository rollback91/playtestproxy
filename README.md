# Play Test Proxy

Play Test Proxy is just another proxy generator for mtg. Inspired by the playtest cards found in the mistery boxes.
The generator can be found at https://rollback91.github.io/playtestproxy.

It supports the deck sintax:
```<number> <card_name>```
for example:
```
1 lightning bolt
1 Aarakocra Sneak
1 Aardwolf's Advantage
1 Ajani, Adversary of Tyrants
1 Personal Decoy
1 Alive
1 Warrant
1 Budoka Gardener
1 Curse of the Fire Penguin
1 Monster
1 Aberrant Researcher
1 Aetherblade Agent
1 Ajani, Nacatl Pariah
1 Azusa's Many Journeys
1 Rowan, Scholar of Sparks
1 Agadeem's Awakening
1 Blightstep Pathway
1 Argoth, Sanctum of Nature
1 Titania, Voice of Gaea
1 Titania, Gaea Incarnate
1 Brisela, Voice of Nightmares
1 Urza, Planeswalker
1 Blacksmith's Talent
1 Druid Class
1 Case of the Burning Masks
1 Case of the Gateway Express
1 A Golden Opportunity
1 Accident-Prone Apprentice
1 Beluna Grandsquall
1 Bant
```
It does not support the card name alone or the inclusion of the set.

## Printing
At the moment only A4 size is supported, letter size will be implemented in the future.
To be able to print correctly you need set those options in the printig settings dialogue:
`Paper size: A4`
`Scale: Fit to page`
`Margins: None`
`Options: Print backgrounds`
